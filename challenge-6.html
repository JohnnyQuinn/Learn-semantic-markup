	This is hard example. No really it's not easy to do this one. 
	Why? it lacks context? What is all of this text and what is it
	talking about? Without that information it's hard to add tags 
	that would clarify the meaning. 

	What is this? It's a tweet. This the text that twitter puts
	in a tweet. 

	Tags you might use: 

	- article
